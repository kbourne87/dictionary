		<h2>Welcome to the About page for the OverExplainer Script!</h2>
		<p> This page will tell you all about this simple script, created by me in order to bring a new feature to your website. Are you an erudite writer, a modern age philosopher, or just a lover of grandiloquent language? Don't let your love of the dictionary leave your readers in the dark! As you can see, this flexible script is designed to read your page, find words that match ones in a dictionary file, and create a box above them with definitions.</p>
		<h2> F.A.Q.</h2>
		<h4> Am I limited to an unchangeable, pre-defined set of words?</h4>
		<p> Absolutely not. The dictionary that this page uses is very limited in scope, although I keep adding to it now and then. If you wanted to change to another list of words, you just need to redirect where the script is looking. Let's take a quick look at what the script does and what it's looking for.</p>
		<img src="/kpbresume/img/scriptimg1.png" width="100%">
		<p>If you right click this page, and select the menu option "view page source," you will find a text page containing all the code for this webpage. Looking at the top, a script loads the relevant javascript dictionary file. In this case, the file is named <strong>"newdictionary.js"</strong> Let's look at what that javascript file looks like.</p>
		<img src="/kpbresume/img/scriptimg3.png" width="100%">
		<p>The file is pretty simple. It is an array containing <strong>key/value</strong> pairs. "Word", "defOne", and "defTwo" are the keys, and the values are the text in quotation marks. The script reads the word key, and displays the text in the defOne and defTwo keys over the word. As you can see, it does not matter what case the word key is in, but the the definition keys will display exactly as written. To add or modify words, simply edit or create a new dictionary file, upload it somewhere that it can be accessed, and redirect the URL for the script at the very top to the new file (as seen in the first picture). <strong>If you change the dictionary</strong>, you will also need to change the code at the bottom to reflect the new name of the array from which it is getting words. Now you can add words in Spanish, Russian, Klingon, or very esoteric words related to particular fanbases or cultures.</p>
		<h4>Is it limited to two definitions per word?</h4>
		<p>Also no! You can have as few or as many definitions as you'd like. Let's take another look at the script proper to see how it works. This is the bottom code previously mentioned.</p>
		<img src="/kpbresume/img/scriptimg2.png" width="100%">
		<p>The relevant part for this question is about two-thirds of the way down line 64. You can see <code>newdictionary[i].defOne</code> and <code>newdictionary[i].defTwo</code>. Be aware that for custom files, every instance of "newdictionary" will need to be changed to the correct, new name of the array you are using (not to be confused with the file name). If you've added or taken out definitions, simply add or take out as many relevant defs as you need.</p>
		<h4>Can I change the box size/style of the border/position/other cosmetic features? Does the word getting the box have to be underlined?</h4>
		<p>You can change many things about how the relevant word and the box looks by changing the CSS of the two classes "def" and "defBox."</p>
		<img src="/kpbresume/img/scriptimg4.png" width="40%">
		<p>To change the word being underlined, change the ".def" property "text-decoration" from underlined to none, or to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-decoration.asp">another option</a>. To change the position of the box, fiddle with the ".defBox" "top" and "left" properties until you find a position you like. Changing the "width" will change how fat the box is. The "border" property, in order as written, describes a border that is 2 pixels thick, dotted, and black in color. Changing those properties allows you to alter size, style, and color of the border of the box. Below that, the "border-radius" style determines how rounded the edges of the box are. The "z-index" property just tells the browser to make it stand out above elements with a lower z-index score (the default for most elements is 1).</p>
