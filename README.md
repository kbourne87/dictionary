# dictionary
Using simple JS, this script looks for a word on the page (between the body tags), sees if it is in the dictionary file, and puts matches in a span.
The span is then set to display a box containing the definition of the word when it is hovered over.
With light modification, custom dictionaries can be used, or it can be set to display an image instead of text.
